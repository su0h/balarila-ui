            <strong style="color: var(--balarila-green)">Balarila</strong> is an innovative <strong>Filipino Grammar Error Correction (GEC) model</strong>, developed as a <strong>proof of concept</strong> through advanced deep learning research. Its core purpose is to demonstrate how AI can tackle a specific, complex challenge: correcting <strong>semantic errors</strong> in Filipino text. Unlike common grammar checkers that only fix spelling or punctuation, Balarila explores the deeper meaning and structural nuances of sentences.

            Our development process involved overcoming significant hurdles, particularly the scarcity of suitable Filipino grammar datasets. We pioneered an <strong>automated error generation pipeline</strong> to create robust synthetic corpora. This unique approach enabled the comprehensive training and fine-tuning of state-of-the-art <strong>Tagalog BERT</strong> and <strong>RoBERTa</strong> models, showcasing the potential for highly accurate Filipino grammar correction.
